# Byte-y
A machine language meant for efficient compiler use.
Built to be a library this will help a (compiler compile / interpreter interpret) into machine code through an easy intermediatory.
This intermediatory will also have support for optimizations taking some load off the compiler/interpreter developer.
Byte-y will be built at first in tandem with XPU, once at a more complete state they will split off.
